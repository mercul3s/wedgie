An elasticsearch Ruby client. 

This is turning into an abandoned project. At the time I started it, I wasn't happy with the existing Elasticsearch Ruby client libraries. Elasticsearch has since come out with their own client library which expands on the previous libraries, and fits more needs for elasticsearch. So, I probably won't continue working on it unless I get bored/inspired.

Currently: support for query string, mappings, and counts.
Eventually: Support for querying against different analyzers, changing Elasticsearch server settings, query dsl
